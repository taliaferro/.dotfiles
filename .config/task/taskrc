# Here is an example of entries that use the default, override and blank values
#   variable=foo   -- By specifying a value, this overrides the default
#   variable=      -- By specifying no value, this means no default
#   #variable=foo  -- By commenting out the line, or deleting it, this uses the default

# You can also refence environment variables:
#   variable=$HOME/task
#   variable=$VALUE

# Use the command 'task show' to see all defaults and overrides
